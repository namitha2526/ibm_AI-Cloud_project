# LearnMate – Agentic AI for Personalized Learning Pathways 🎓🤖

Built as part of the **IBM SkillsBuild Internship on AI and Cloud Technologies** , *LearnMate* is a smart educational assistant powered by an AI agent developed using **IBM Watsonx.ai**.

This project focuses entirely on designing and deploying a standalone AI agent capable of generating personalized course pathways based on user goals, interests, and knowledge level.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To create an intelligent, prompt-engineered agent that helps users discover structured learning paths for careers like Data Scientist, Web Developer, or AI Engineer — all generated dynamically using a foundation model.

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **IBM Watsonx.ai – Prompt Lab**  
  Designed and refined natural language prompts.

- **IBM Watsonx.ai – Runtime**  
  Deployed the agent and tested output in real-time.

- **Foundation Models (FM)**  
  Leveraged IBM’s large language models to power personalized recommendations.

---

## ⚙️ Agent Capabilities

- Accepts natural language queries such as:
  - "I want to become a data scientist"
  - "Suggest a roadmap for AI/ML learning"
- Responds with:
  - Personalized course suggestions (free/paid)
  - Skill progression timeline (beginner to advanced)
  - Tools, technologies, and learning priorities

---

## 📌 Highlights

- No frontend or backend – pure AI agent logic
- Built and deployed fully in **IBM Watsonx environment**
- Outputs are accurate, structured, and tailored to each input prompt
- Developed and tested independently

---

## 📜 Outcome

- Successfully built and deployed a live agent using Watsonx Runtime
- Delivered intelligent, dynamic course plans with zero code UI
- Internship completed and certified under IBM SkillsBuild
